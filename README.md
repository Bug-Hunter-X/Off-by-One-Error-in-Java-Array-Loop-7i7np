This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java that occurs when iterating through arrays. The error is caused by using `i <= array.length` in the `for` loop, which attempts to access an index beyond the bounds of the array.  The solution shows the correct way to iterate using `i < array.length`.  This is a subtle but frequently encountered error that can lead to runtime exceptions.
